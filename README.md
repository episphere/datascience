## Data Science Group
#### Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG)
#### National Institutes of Health (NIH) / National Cancer Institute (NCI)

Established in 2019 with the recruitment of DCEG's [inaugural Chief Data Scientist](https://irp.nih.gov/catalyst/v27i2/colleagues-recently-tenured), [Jonas Almeida](https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/biographies/A-J/almeida-jonas), the Data Science Group seeks to advance research and infrastructure for data-intensive Population Studies.
### Goal
The two primary goals of the Data Science Group are to accelerate the investigation of epidemiologic and genetic causes of cancer, and to advance Cloud Computing infrastructure for Precision Prevention. These goals will be pursued as a multidisciplinary research program that combines systems biology, computational statistics, artificial intelligence, and software engineering for biomedical applications.
### Training
Outreach through Education and development of trans-disciplinary human resources is the third primary goal of the Data Science Group, and is articulated as part of, or deriving from, weekly [Cloud4Bio Hackathons](https://cloud4bio.github.io) at NCI Shaddy grove.
