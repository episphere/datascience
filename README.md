## [DCEG Data Science Group](https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/organization/programs-ebp/datascience)
#### Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG)<br>National Institutes of Health (NIH) / National Cancer Institute (NCI)

Established in 2019 with the recruitment of DCEG's [inaugural Chief Data Scientist](https://irp.nih.gov/catalyst/v27i2/colleagues-recently-tenured), [Jonas Almeida](https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/biographies/A-J/almeida-jonas), the Data Science Group seeks to advance research and infrastructure for data-intensive Precision Prevention studies.
### Goals
The main goal of the Data Science Group is to accelerate the investigation of epidemiologic and genetic causes of cancer, and to advance Cloud Computing infrastructure for Precision Prevention. These two aims are pursued as a multidisciplinary research program that combines systems biology, computational statistics, artificial intelligence, and software engineering for biomedical applications.
### Training
Outreach through Education and development of trans-disciplinary human resources is the third aim of the Data Science Group, and is articulated by weekly [Cloud4Bio Hackathons](https://cloud4bio.github.io) at NCI's Shady Grove campus.
### EpiSphere
The evolution of the Web towards a global data space is opening entirely new opportunities to cancer prevention and to understing its natural history. This is a technology development particulalry well suited to Epidemiology, challanged by the widening diversity of data types and increasngly sensitive governance of data sources. These former range from digital pathology to wearable devices, while the later stretches from federal and state sponsored reference data sources to consumer-facing services. EpiSphere is therefore conceived as an epidemiology approach to the broader [NIH datacommons initiative](https://commonfund.nih.gov/commons) to advance interoperable data ecosystems, in a manner that is driven by specific data-intensive projects at [DCEG](https://dceg.cancer.gov). This practical focus drives the development of Data Science as computational infrastructure enabled by scalable Cloud Computing and Artificial Intelligence (AI) made available by the [NIH STRIDES](https://datascience.nih.gov/strides) initiative. In a nutshell, epiSphere is an humbrella computational epidemiolgoy initiative developed as infrastructure for data science projects.
